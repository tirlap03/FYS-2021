The code lies under the Assignment 1 folder, and the file is called "Assignment1_tla141.py"

The code is written on WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux), and has not been tested on any other system, but as far I know it works without any bugs.

To run the code write: 
      python3 Assignment1_tla141.py
in your designated terminal
